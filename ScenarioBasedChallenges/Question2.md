# Scenario: Implementing Zero Trust Architecture 

## Question: Your company is transitioning to a Zero Trust security model for its cloud infrastructure. Outline the key components of Zero Trust architecture and explain how you would implement this model. What challenges might you face, and how would you address them? 

## Answer
The Zero Trust architecture relies on several key components and principles to ensure comprehensive security:

Comprehensive Identity Management: All access subjects, including people and devices, should be identified and authenticated.

Application-Level Access Control: Access should be evaluated at the application layer rather than the network layer.

Adaptive Trust: Trust levels are dynamically adjusted based on attributes, behaviors, and context.

Least-Privileged Access: Access is granted using the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users and devices have only the permissions they need.

Continuous Monitoring: Implement continuous monitoring and analytics to detect and respond to threats in real time
